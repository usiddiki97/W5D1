# Phase 2: Hashing

# Notes:

# Don't spend more than 20 minutes working on hashing functions. Great hashing functions
# are hard to write. Your goal is to write a good-enough hashing function and move forth
# to the fun stuff ahead! Call over a TA if needed.
# Avoid using byebug inside your hash methods. The functioning of byebug's internal
# code will cause this to break since it calls Array#hash.
# You may want to refer to the resource on XOR. Please read the intro and section about
# exclusive or (^ in Ruby). XOR is a great tool for hashing because it's fast, and it
# provides a good, nearly uniform output of bits.
# A hash function is a sequence of mathematical operations that deterministically maps
# any arbitrary data into a pre-defined range of values. Anything that does that is a
# hash function. However, a good hash function satisfies the property of being uniform
# in how it distributes that data over its range of values.

# To create a good hash function, we want to be able to hash absolutely anything. That
# includes integers, strings, arrays, and even other hashes.

# Also, a hash function should be deterministic, meaning that it should always produce
# the same value given the same input. It's also essential that equivalent objects produce
# the same hash. So if we have two arrays, each equal to [1, 2, 3], we want them both to
# hash to the same value.

# So let's construct a nice hashing function that'll do that for us. Be creative here!

# Write hash functions for Array, String, and Hash. Build these up sequentially.



# Use Integer#hash as a base hashing function. The trick here will be to create a scheme
# to convert instances of each class to a Integer and then apply this hashing function.
# This can be used on Numerics such as the index of an array element.
# Don't try to overwrite Ruby's native Integer#hash; making a hash function for numbers
# is something that's outside the scope of this assignment.
# Ordering of elements is essential to hashing an Array or String. This means each element
# in an Array or String should be associated with its index during hashing.
# Ex. [1, 2, 3].hash == [3, 2, 1].hash # => false
# On the other hand, ordering is not to be considered with a Hash. Hashes are based on
# sets and have no fixed order. Ex. {a: 1, b: 2}.hash == {b: 2, a: 1}.hash # => true
# Hints:

# Can you write String#hash in terms of Array#hash?
# When you get to hashing hashes: one trick to make a hash function order-agnostic is to
# turn the object into an array, stably sort the array, and then hash the array. This'll
# make it so every unordered version of that same object will hash to the same value.

class Integer
  # Integer#hash already implemented for you

class Array
  def hash
    return 0.hash if empty?
    hash_sum = 0
    each_with_index {|num, i| hash_sum = num.hash + i.hash }
    hash_sum
  end
end


class String
  def hash
    letters = ('a'..'z').to_a
    hash_sum = 0
    each_char.with_index {|char, i| hash_sum = letters.index(char).hash + i.hash}
    hash_sum
  end
end

class Hash
  # This returns 0 because rspec will break if it returns nil
  # Make sure to implement an actual Hash#hash method
  def hash
    0
    to_a.sort.hash
  end
  
end
